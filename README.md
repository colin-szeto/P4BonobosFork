# Period 4 Bonobos
We are creating a random fact generator website that pulls the facts from a database. On the about page, we will be discussing who we are and the purpose of this project. On the database page, there will be a query so that if the audience wants to search up a fact that stood out from earlier, they would be able to find it.
